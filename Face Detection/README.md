This mini project does comparison of Face Detection Techniques.
Part 1 uses Cascade Classifier available via open-cv library in python which uses pre-trained model whose code is forked from open-cv github repository.It uses 'haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml' file in its execution.

Part 2 uses Multi-Task-Cascaded-Convolutional-Networks(MTCNN) which is imported via keras and tensorflow library in python.This is deep learning based technique hence more efficient than part 1.
