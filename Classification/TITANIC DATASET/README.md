This is a initial kaggle submission.
Since, I thought I was pretty good at modelling, I gave it a try.
Having read few chapters of O'Reilly, one get too confident in ML I think.
Anyways, you will not find any advanced EDA here.
Applied are various ML algorithms and seen how hyperparameters tuning works.
Everything is personalized here.
