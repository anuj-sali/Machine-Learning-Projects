This is basically my journey from Novice to to-be-named.
This module consists of series of kaggle submissions to the titanic problem.
Mistakes did in every notebook is HIGHLIGHTED for reference.
Anyways, you will not find any advanced EDA here. I may include it in future.
Everything is personalized here.
Hope you enjoy!
