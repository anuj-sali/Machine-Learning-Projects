This is a typical Housing Price Prediction Supervised ML problem in which I have used different algorithms of regression ranging from Linear Regression to all the way to Random Forest to improve the performance of ML model.
The main highlight is Hyperparameter Tuning in which I have used RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV.
